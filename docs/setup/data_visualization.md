# Data Visualization

The **Visualization** panel in ALchemist displays a 2D scatter plot of your experiment data and search space.

- **Variable Selection:**  
  Use the dropdown menus above the plot to choose which variables to display on the x and y axes.

- **Pool Points:**  
  Light blue, semi-transparent dots represent the pool of potential experiment points generated from your variable space.

- **Sampled Points:**  
  Green dots show the experiments you have already run or loaded.

- **Suggested Next Point:**  
  A blue diamond marker will appear after you train a model and run an acquisition function, indicating the next recommended experiment.

Currently, only 2D scatter plots are supported. Future updates may add more visualization options, such as 3D plots or advanced data views.
