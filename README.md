**ALchemist: Active Learning Toolkit for Chemical and Materials Research**

ALchemist is a modular Python toolkit that brings active learning and Bayesian optimization to experimental design in chemical and materials research. It is designed for scientists and engineers who want to efficiently explore or optimize high-dimensional variable spaces—without writing code—using an intuitive graphical interface.

**NREL Software Record:** SWR-25-102

## 🚀 Overview

ALchemist accelerates discovery and optimization by combining:

- **Flexible variable space definition:** Real, integer, and categorical variables with bounds or discrete values.
- **Probabilistic surrogate modeling:** Gaussian process regression via BoTorch or scikit-optimize backends.
- **Advanced acquisition strategies:** Efficient sampling using qEI, qPI, qUCB, and qNegIntegratedPosteriorVariance.
- **Modern web interface:** React-based UI with FastAPI backend for seamless active learning workflows.
- **Autonomous optimization:** Human-out-of-the-loop optimization for real-time process control.
- **Experiment tracking:** CSV logging, reproducible random seeds, and error tracking.
- **Extensibility:** Abstract interfaces for models and acquisition functions enable future backend and workflow expansion.

### Use Cases

- **Interactive Optimization**: Desktop GUI or web UI for manual experiment design
- **Programmatic Workflows**: Python Session API for scripts and notebooks
- **Autonomous Operation**: REST API for real-time process control (reactors, synthesis, etc.)
- **Remote Collaboration**: Web-based interface accessible from any device

## 🧭 Quick Start

### Web Application (Recommended)

**Development Mode:**
```bash
# Option 1: Manual start
python run_api.py              # Terminal 1: Backend (port 8000)
cd alchemist-web && npm run dev  # Terminal 2: Frontend (port 5173)

# Option 2: Automated start
scripts\dev_start.bat    # Windows
./scripts/dev_start.sh   # Linux/Mac
```

**Production Mode:**
```bash
# Build and run
scripts\build_production.bat    # Windows
./scripts/build_production.sh   # Linux/Mac

# Start production server
python run_api.py --production

# Access at: http://localhost:8000
```

**Docker Deployment:**
```bash
# Build frontend first
cd alchemist-web && npm run build && cd ..

# Run with Docker Compose
cd docker
docker-compose up --build
```

### Python Package Installation

Requirements: Python 3.9 or higher

We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to manage your Python environments.

**1. Create a new environment:**
```bash
conda create -n alchemist-env python=3.12
conda activate alchemist-env
```

**2. Install ALchemist:**

*Option A: Install directly from GitHub:*
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/NREL/ALchemist.git
```

*Option B: Clone and install (recommended for development):*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NREL/ALchemist.git
cd ALchemist
python -m pip install -e .
```

All dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml` and will be installed automatically.

For step-by-step instructions, see the [Getting Started](https://nrel.github.io/ALchemist/) section of the documentation.

## 🛠️ Development Status

ALchemist is under active development at NREL as part of the DataHub project within the ChemCatBio consortium. It is designed to be approachable for non-ML researchers and extensible for advanced users. Planned features include:

- Enhanced initial sampling and DoE methods
- Additional model types and acquisition strategies
- Improved visualization tools
- GUI reimplementation in PySide6 for broader compatibility
- Support for multi-output models and multi-objective optimization
